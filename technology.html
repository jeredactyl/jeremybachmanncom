    <h1>Travel</h1>
    <h2>Google Flights</h2>
    <p>
      Start your search on
      <a href="https://www.google.com/flights" target="_blank">Google Flights</a
      >. It will quickly tell you airlines, flights, and prices. Its calendar
      function shows the cheapest days to fly to your destination. If you have
      dates, but no destination picked, select "United States" for your
      destination and Google Flights will pull up a map of select cities in your
      price range.
    </p>

    <h2>Point.me</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.point.me/" target="_blank">Point.me</a> is my go-to
      points search engine. The service scours the airlines for award
      availability to show what's available on your searched dates. It will even
      give you step-by-step instructions on how to book it once you've chosen
      it. The site costs $12.95 each month (as of 03/22/2023), but has saved me
      hundreds just this year.
    </p>
    <h2>AwardWallet</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://awardwallet.com/?refCode=jyvt6isji3" target="_blank"
        >AwardWallet</a
      >
      AwardWallet allows me to track and manage any type of loyalty account. It
      offers an easy-to-use dashboard that stores all my travel assets in one
      place, helping me to get a better understanding of my point wealth, so I
      can make strategic decisions when booking awards.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also use the Merchant Category Lookup Tool to make sure I'm using the
      best card at that retailer. The Credit Card Spend Analysis report shows me
      where I could have gotten a better deal with a different card. Although I
      prefer TripIt to track my itineraries, AwardWallet has a pretty good one,
      too; it automatically adds flight itineraries and sends reminders and
      status updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use my coupon <mark>free-3y31pm8vz3</mark>, you can get a free
      upgrade after registering.
    </p>
    <h2>TripIt</h2>
    <p>
      After I book a flight, hotel, or activity, I forward the itineraries to my
      <a href="https://www.tripit.com/" target="_blank">TripIt</a> account. It
      pulls all the information into an itinerary for me. It syncs to my
      calendar and allows everyone in the family to have everyone's flight
      information. With my TripIt Pro account, I get real-time flight alerts,
      check-in reminders, airfare price drop notifications, and seat tracking,
      too.
