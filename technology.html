    <h1>Travel Applications and Websites</h1>
    <h2>Google Flights</h2>
    <p>
      Start your search on
      <a href="https://www.google.com/flights" target="_blank">Google Flights</a
      >. It will quickly tell you airlines, flights, and prices. Its calendar
      function shows the cheapest days to fly to your destination. If you have
      dates, but no destination picked, select "United States" for your
      destination and Google Flights will pull up a map of select cities in your
      price range.
    </p>

    <h2>Point.me</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.point.me/" target="_blank">Point.me</a> is my go-to
      points search engine. The service scours the airlines for award
      availability to show what's available on your searched dates. It will even
      give you step-by-step instructions on how to book it once you've chosen
      it. The site costs $12.95 each month (as of 03/22/2023), but has saved me
      hundreds just this year.
    </p>
    <h2>AwardWallet</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://awardwallet.com/?refCode=jyvt6isji3" target="_blank"
        >AwardWallet</a
      >
      AwardWallet allows me to track and manage any type of loyalty account -
      most importantly, credit card and airline points and miles. It offers an
      easy-to-use dashboard that stores all my travel assets in one place,
      helping me to get a better understanding of my point wealth, so I can make
      strategic decisions when booking awards.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also use the Merchant Category Lookup Tool to make sure I'm using the
      best card at that retailer. The Credit Card Spend Analysis report shows me
      where I could have gotten a better deal with a different card. Although I
      prefer TripIt to track my itineraries, AwardWallet has a pretty good one,
      too; it automatically adds flight itineraries and sends reminders and
      status updates.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you use my coupon <mark>free-3y31pm8vz3</mark>, you can get a free
      upgrade after registering.
    </p>
    <h2>TripIt</h2>
    <p>
      After I book a flight, hotel, or activity, I forward the itineraries to my
      <a href="https://www.tripit.com/" target="_blank">TripIt</a> account. It
      pulls all the information into an itinerary for me. It syncs to my
      calendar and allows everyone in the family to have everyone's flight
      information. With my TripIt Pro account, I get real-time flight alerts,
      check-in reminders, airfare price drop notifications, and seat tracking,
      too.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recently got a text from my TripIt Pro account telling me the price had
      dropped for my upcoming Southwest flight to Kansas City. I quickly logged
      into Southwest and was able to shave $12 of a different trip to
      Albuquerque that's coming up. Just this feature alone pays for the Pro
      subscription to TripIt.

      <a href="https://amzn.to/3TGlbYm">AirTags</a> have rescued my family
      multiple times since they first came out. I keep them in our luggage and
      on my wallet. On a recent trip to New Orleans, I left my bag in the taxi
      from the airport. With AirTags, I was able to see where the cab was as I
      frantically called to get my stuff back. In Ethiopia, the airline insisted
      my luggage was still at Heathrow and would arrive the next day. I
      persuaded them that my bag was, in fact, in the terminal and we could go
      get it at that moment.

      This <a href="https://amzn.to/3K6VtsU">portable charger</a> is a little
      bigger than a Max-sized iPhone and weighs a little more than the phone.
      While smaller would be nicer, the power makes it worthwhile. It can charge
      an iPhone 12 to 50% in 30 minutes. It will fully charge a phone several
      times - it claims 5, but I've never tried. Someone in my family is almost
      out of battery when we travel, so it's a life saver, too.

      Right before international trips, my house is aflame with people worried
      their suitcases are overweight. And, they usually are. This<a
        href="https://amzn.to/3K7sKnW"
        >two-pack of digital scales</a
      >
      are accurate and inexpensive enough to buy two. So, more family members
      can weigh and pack at the same time! You can also pack one with you so all
      the newly acquired items from your trip don't lead to overweight bag fees.

      More than one person has told me it looks like I have handcuffs on my
      backpack. It's just this<a href="https://amzn.to/3JJhgp5">carabiner</a>
      that lives on my backpack. I didn't know I needed this until I had one. It
      unfolds into a hook, which you can hook on the inside of public bathroom
      stalls, on your chair in a restaurant, or out of the way in your hotel
      room. You can hook your water bottle to it
