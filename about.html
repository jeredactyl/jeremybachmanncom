      <p>Hey friends, â€”</p>

      <p>
        Travel was part of my life from my earliest memory. My father was a
        private pilot so our vacations took us anywhere in the United States and
        Mexico that my dad could fly himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I was eight years old, we flew our plane from California to Maine
        over a six-week span, stopping in multiple states along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later, while doing my undergraduate studies at UCLA, I took every
        opportunity I could to study abroad. I spent time in Guadalajara, Mexico
        and my whole senior year in Delhi, India. In fact, I was gone so much I
        had take random summer school classes when I returned to the states to
        meet the "residency requirement" for the university!
      </p>
      <p>
        After university, as I begin my career, I couldn't stop exploring. I
        used vacation time to take long-distance bus trips around the
        countrywide of Mexico, exploring less visited areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I met my wife, who is from Ethiopia, in graduate school. Having family
        in Ethiopia, we've visited many times over the years. Each visit, I try
        to take a side trip to an area of Ethiopia that I haven't been before.
      </p>
      <p>
        People frequently comment to me "You've seen more of my country than I
        have!," whether they're American, Indian, Mexican, or Ethiopian. I'm
        motivated to write down my experience and how I'm able to do it to
        motivate the average person, who works a "typical" job and has
        traditional family and job responsibilities that they can still travel
        more than they think and more affordably.
      </p>
      <p>
        My travel style varies, depending on the trip. My $3/night string bed
        days are behind me, and I want to push my travel budget relatively far.
        I look to save money on airfare and lodging using credit card points and
        hotel loyalty programs, typically.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do I decide where to go? Today, I look to go places that I haven't
        been before, using NomadMania's 1301 world regions of
        <a href="https://nomadmania.travel/profile/34230">
          as my guide and inspiration.</a

        I'm a huge Deadhead. I might have seen my
