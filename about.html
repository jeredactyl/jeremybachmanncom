      <p>Hey friends, —</p>
      <p>
        I'm Jeremy and I'm a polymath - a "Master Generalist." I've accumulated
        a wide-ranging set of experiences as I move from one thing to another.
        I've spent a good amount of time in India, Mexico, and Ethiopia, I've
        got a private pilot's license, an Advanced Open Water Diver SCUBA, can
        speak decent Spanish, but can read/write/speak elementary Hindi and
        Amharic.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked in Technology and Marketing roles in financial services,
        most recently
        <a href="https://pennymac.com" target="_blank">Pennymac</a> and
        <a href="https://bankofamerica.com" target="_blank">Bank of America</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I received my BA from UCLA, where I focused on South Asian History
        mostly. I received my MBA from the Claremont Graduate University, where
        I studied with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker" target="_blank"
          >Peter Drucker</a
        >. I'm a Deadhead.
