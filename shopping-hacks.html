<h1>Rakuten</h1>
<p>
  Rakuten is an online shopping portal that used to be called Ebates. It's an
  easy way to earn extra cash on top of the points you're getting back from your
  credit card spend. I've been getting a couple hundreds dollars a quarter from
  Rakuten lately just by doing my normal shopping for groceries, clothes,
  software, trip activities, flowers, and cosmetics (wife and daughters).

  There are many shopping portals out there, including those from the airlines.
  Ultimately, after using many shopping portals to maximize the cash back
  percentage, I settled on using Rakuten almost all the time.

  Using Rakuten is simple for me. I just installed the Chrome browser extension.
  When a site has a deal with Rakuten, a pop-up appears, telling me what the
  cash-back percentage is for that site. Other times, if I'm going to buy
  something at Amazon or REI, Rakuten will pop up explaining that the product is
  available cheaper somewhere else and I can get cash back.

  Interesting note: A friend showed me that Rakuten was deducting $2.00 each
  month from his account balance. After reading the Rakuten Terms and
  Conditions, I see they can debit your Rakuten account $5.00 each month as a
  "maintenance fee" if you haven't used Rakuten in the past 12 months.
