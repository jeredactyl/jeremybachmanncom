    <p>
      The best advice is to try to begin every shopping trip inside a shopping
      portal. Supplement that with discounted gift cards loaded onto the site.
      Then, use the credit card that offers you maximum savings in terms of that
      spending category.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, as I'm writing this, the awesome shoe company Allbirds is offering 5%
      back on my Chase Freedom Unlimited (up to $10 back). This is through Chase
      Offers. This is on top of the 1.5% that I'm getting back for this using
      this card for this purchase. Rakuten is then paying 2% cash back for
      shopping through its portal. On a hypothetical $100 pair of shoes, I'm
      getting $6.50 from Chase and $2 from Rakuten. My $100 shoes are $91.50
      before I've done anything but shop at I normally would.
    </p>

    <h1>Shopping Portals</h1>
    <p>
      An online shopping portal is a website from which you originate an online
      shopping trip. The site offers a discount for the merchants in its portal.
      There are airline, credit card, and cash back portals. I have accounts
      with Southwest, United, and American Airlines, as well as with Chase.
      Ultimately, I decided to originate almost all my portal traffic from
      Rakuten.
    </p>
    <h2>Rakuten</h2>
    <p>
      Rakuten is an online shopping portal that used to be called Ebates. It's
      an easy way to earn extra cash on top of the points you're getting back
      from your credit card spend. I've been getting
      <strong>a couple hundreds dollars a quarter</strong> from Rakuten lately
      just by doing my normal shopping for groceries, clothes, software, trip
      activities, flowers, and cosmetics (wife and daughters).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many shopping portals out there, including those from the
      airlines. Ultimately, after using many shopping portals to maximize the
      cash back percentage, I settled on using Rakuten almost all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using Rakuten is simple for me. I just installed the Chrome browser
      extension. When a site has a deal with Rakuten, a pop-up appears, telling
      me what the cash-back percentage is for that site. Other times, if I'm
      going to buy something at Amazon or REI, Rakuten will pop up explaining
      that the product is available cheaper somewhere else and I can get cash
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interesting note: A friend showed me that Rakuten was deducting $2.00 each
      month from his account balance. After reading the Rakuten Terms and
      Conditions, I see they can debit your Rakuten account $5.00 each month as
      a "maintenance fee" if you haven't used Rakuten in the past 12 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you
      <a
        href="https://www.rakuten.com/r/JEREMY25359?eeid=28187"
        target="_blank"
      >
        sign up for Rakuten with my link</a
      >, you'll get $30 back on the first $30 you spend at Rakuten.
    </p>

    <h2>Cashback Monitor</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to juggle a few online portals to get maximum value, you need
      <a href="https://www.cashbackmonitor.com/" target="_blank"
        >Cashback Monitor</a
      >. Cashback Monitor is a free site that allows you to track which portals
      have the best rates at that moment. For example, the best reward rate at
      this moment for Sephora purchases is the Chase Portal (8%), followed by
      American Airlines (7%), and Rakuten at "up to 6%."
    </p>

    <h1>Gift Cards and Discounts</h1>
    <h2>AARP</h2>
    <p>
      You don't have to be a retiree or a senior citizen to join
      <a href="https://www.aarp.org/" target="_blank">AARP</a>. And, AARP
      membership quickly pays for itself. I take advantage of AARP's discounted
      gift cards every month. Members are limited to 5 each month. I've bought
      REI, Vons, DoorDash, Fandango, and 1-800-Flowers gift cards, saving 8% to
      20% in the process. Stack that on top of a 1.5% regular spend on a Chase
      Freedom Unlimited before I've even started shopping.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other benefit I use regularly is quick access to Valvoline oil change
      coupons when I don't have a better one in my email.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't forget to
      <a href="https://www.rakuten.com/r/JEREMY25359?eeid=28187" target="_blank"
        >join Rakuten</a
      >
      first to get an extra discount on AARP membership!
