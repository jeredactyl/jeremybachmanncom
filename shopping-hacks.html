    <h1>Rakuten</h1>
    <p>
      Rakuten is an online shopping portal that used to be called Ebates. It's
      an easy way to earn extra cash on top of the points you're getting back
      from your credit card spend. I've been getting a couple hundreds dollars a
      quarter from Rakuten lately just by doing my normal shopping for
      groceries, clothes, software, trip activities, flowers, and cosmetics
      (wife and daughters).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many shopping portals out there, including those from the
      airlines. Ultimately, after using many shopping portals to maximize the
      cash back percentage, I settled on using Rakuten almost all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using Rakuten is simple for me. I just installed the Chrome browser
      extension. When a site has a deal with Rakuten, a pop-up appears, telling
      me what the cash-back percentage is for that site. Other times, if I'm
      going to buy something at Amazon or REI, Rakuten will pop up explaining
      that the product is available cheaper somewhere else and I can get cash
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interesting note: A friend showed me that Rakuten was deducting $2.00 each
      month from his account balance. After reading the Rakuten Terms and
      Conditions, I see they can debit your Rakuten account $5.00 each month as
      a "maintenance fee" if you haven't used Rakuten in the past 12 months.
