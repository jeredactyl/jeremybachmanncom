  I love exploring the world. Over the years, I've done deep travel in the
  United States, Mexico, India, and Ethiopia. Since COVID-19, I've committed to
  seeing as many new areas of the world as I can.

  To that end, I've been using the 1301 world regions of

<p>Here are some of the airline tricks I've learned:</p>

<h1>Southwest Airlines</h1>
<p>
  Southwest is a popular airline in my family. It flies out of my two local
  airports - BUR and LAX. Every hour, it flies to the Bay Area, where we have
  family and my daughters went to college.

<h2>Hack #1: Book your flight, then check the pricing regularly.</h2>

<h2>Hack #2: Wanna Get Away Plus</h2>

  Credits can be transferred to anyone with a Rapid Rewarda account, not just
  for you.

<p>
  You can also make confirmed same-day flight changes without paying a fee. This
  is not only nice to get on an earlier or later flight if you want, it can be
  used to get you the flight you really want, if you're up for the risk. Just
  book the cheapest flight for that day - these are usually really early or late
  in the day. Then, at 12:00:01 after midnight, log on to Southwest.com and
  change the flight to the one you really want. But, if your ideal flight is
  booked, be prepared to get to the airport at the crack of dawn!
