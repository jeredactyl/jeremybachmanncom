    <p>
      I love exploring the world. Over the years, I've done deep travel in the
      United States, Mexico, India, and Ethiopia. Since COVID-19, I've committed
      to seeing as many new areas of the world as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      To that end, I've been using the 1301 world regions of
      <a href="https://nomadmania.travel/profile/34230">
        NomadMania as my guide and inspiration.</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>Here are some of the airline tricks I've learned:</p>

    <img src="images/swa_logo_dark.svg" />
    <h1>Southwest Airlines</h1>
    <p>
      Southwest is a popular airline in my family. It flies out of my two local
      airports - BUR and LAX. Every hour, it flies to the Bay Area, where we
      have family and my daughters went to college. We don't have to price out
      the flight a la carte to see if we're getting a good deal (looking at you,
      Spirit Airlines). 2 bags included, no thinking involved.
    </p>

    <h2>Hack #1: Book your flight, then check the pricing regularly.</h2>
    <p>
      Southwest Airlines provide customers the ability to rebook their flight
      anytime between initial booking and 10 minutes before the flight leaves.
      You can receive the difference back in cash, Travel Funds, transferable
      flight credits, or points. Recently, I booked two tickets to Kansas City
      for a family event. I checked the price on southwest.com a few times and
      was able to shave $50 off each ticket a few weeks later.
    </p>

    <h2>Hack #2: Wanna Get Away Plus</h2>
    <p>
      Credits can be transferred to anyone with a Rapid Rewarda account, not
      just for you. This is a great benefit for us, as someone in my family
      almost always has an upcoming Southwest flight. We can transfer credits
      between all four of us.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also make confirmed same-day flight changes without paying a fee.
      This is not only nice to get on an earlier or later flight if you want, it
      can be used to get you the flight you really want, if you're up for the
      risk. Just book the cheapest flight for that day - these are usually
      really early or late in the day. Then, at 12:00:01 after midnight, log on
      to Southwest.com and change the flight to the one you really want. But, if
      your ideal flight is booked, be prepared to get to the airport at the
      crack of dawn!
