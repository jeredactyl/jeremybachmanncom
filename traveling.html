      I love exploring the world. Over the years, I've done deep travel in the
      United States, Mexico, India, and Ethiopia. Since COVID-19, I've committed
      to seeing as many new areas of the world as I can.
    </p>
    <p>
      To that end, I've been using the 1301 world regions of
      <a href="https://nomadmania.travel/profile/34230">
        NomadMania as my guide and inspiration.</a

    </p>

    <p>Here are some of the airline tricks I've learned:</p>

          id="collapseOne"
          class="accordion-collapse collapse show"
          data-bs-parent="#accordionExample"

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>
              Southwest is a popular airline in my family. It flies out of my
              two local airports - BUR and LAX. Every hour, it flies to the Bay
              Area, where we have family and my daughters went to college. We
              don't have to price out the flight a la carte to see if we're
              getting a good deal (looking at you, Spirit Airlines). 2 bags
              included, no thinking involved.
            </p>

            <h4>
              Hack #1: Book your flight, then check the pricing regularly.
            </h4>
            <p>
              Southwest Airlines provide customers the ability to rebook their
              flight anytime between initial booking and 10 minutes before the
              flight leaves. You can receive the difference back in cash, Travel
              Funds, transferable flight credits, or points. Recently, I booked
              two tickets to Kansas City for a family event. I checked the price
              on southwest.com a few times and was able to shave $50 off each
              ticket a few weeks later.
            </p>

            <h4>Hack #2: Wanna Get Away Plus&trade;</h4>
            <p>
              Credits can be transferred to anyone with a Rapid Rewarda account,
              not just for you. This is a great benefit for us, as someone in my
              family almost always has an upcoming Southwest flight. We can
              transfer credits between all four of us.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can also make confirmed same-day flight changes without paying
              a fee. This is not only nice to get on an earlier or later flight
              if you want, it can be used to get you the flight you really want,
              if you're up for the risk. Just book the cheapest flight for that
              day - these are usually really early or late in the day. Then, at
              12:00:01 after midnight, log on to Southwest.com and change the
              flight to the one you really want. But, if your ideal flight is
              booked, be prepared to get to the airport at the crack of dawn!
            </p>

            <h4>Hack #3: Southwest Gift Cards</h4>
            <p>
              Southwest gift cards pop up on sale at Best Buy, Target, and other
              places for 8% to 10% off all the time. There are some downsides -
              you won't earn the 3% on travel that Chase cards can give on
              travel, since these will code as regular shopping. Also, A
              Southwest gift card used for travel is not refundable. If you end
              up not taking the flight, the gift card amount becomes flight
              credit at Southwest.

            aria-expanded="false"

          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>
              We joke about Spirit all the time in my family, but we keep flying
              it when it's often so much less expensive than competing flights.
              You should always do the math to see if it's really cheaper after
              you add bags, though.
            </p>
            <p>
              Update: Spirit recently ran a
              <a href="https://spirit.statusmatch.com/" target="_blank"
                >status match campaign</a
              >
              that enabled me to upgrade my status to
              <a href="https://www.spirit.com/free-spirit" target="_blank">
                Free Spirit Gold&reg;</a
              >. On top of other benefits, this means no more bag fees while I
              hold the status. This makes Spirit a much more attractive option
              in many cases.
            </p>
            <h4>Hack #1 - Use WhatsApp or Text for Customer Service</h4>
            <p>
              If you call or use the chat function on the website, expect to
              sometimes wait more than an hour. I've had good luck getting an
              answer in minutes by texting "Hello" to
              <a href="sms:+18557283555?&body=Hello">(855) 728-3555</a>.

      <h1>Using Our iPhones Phone Abroad: A Guide for iPhone Users</h1>
      <p>
        Using your US-based phone abroad can be confusing and expensive. You can
        try to depend on public wifi, but you never know if it will be available
        wherever you end up. In this post, we will explore the most economical
        options for iPhone users planning a trip to Belize with a
        <strong>Verizon 5G Play More plan</strong>.
      </p>
      <h2>Verizon Travel Options</h2>
      <p>
        Verizon offers two international travel options for iPhone users:
        <a
          href="https://www.verizon.com/plans/international/international-travel/travel-pass/"
          target="_blank"
          >TravelPass</a
        >
        and the
        <a
          href="https://www.verizon.com/plans/international/international-travel/monthly-plan/"
          target="_blank"
          >International Monthly Travel Plan</a
        >. The TravelPass costs $10/day per line, with unlimited data and texts.
        It offers 2GB of high-speed data before converting to 3G. The
        International Travel Plan costs $100/month, providing unlimited data and
        texts, with 20GB of high-speed data. For a 9-day trip to Belize, the
        total cost for TravelPass would be $360, while the International Travel
        Plan would cost $400.
      </p>
      <h2>Airalo eSIM</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.airalo.com/" target="_blank">Airalo</a> offers
        eSIMs for over 200 countries and regions. It caters to travelers who
        regularly visit other countries and want to use their phones. The eSIMs
        provided by Airalo are data-only, which means they do not have a phone
        number assigned and cannot make or receive calls or text messages;
        however, they do provide ultra-fast mobile data at nearly local prices.
      </p>

      <p>
        Airalo utilizes multiple networks to provide service instead of building
        its own infrastructure. You can manage your eSIM plans through the
        Airalo app. Using Airalo eSIMs, we no longer need to change SIM cards or
        carry multiple SIM cards when going abroad. In Belize, their Cho! Card
        uses the BTL network and provides 1GB of data for 7 days at a cost of
        $9.50. To use an eSIM as your travel line on iOS,
        <a href="https://www.airalo.com/installation-guide/ios" target="_blank"
          >follow these steps</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you sign up for Airalo,
        <mark>use my referral code JEREMY1716</mark> to get $3 off your first
        eSIM purchase.
      </p>
      <h2>Google Fi</h2>
      <p>
        Google Fi is an option for international travel, but its terms state
        that it should be used primarily in the US and not just for
        international travel. To me, it looks like a great plan for digital
        nomads; I plan to keep my Verizon plan in the US for now.
      </p>
      <h2>Rely on Free WiFi</h2>
      <p>
        Another option is to rely on free WiFi at your destination. While this
        option is not always reliable or secure, it can be a cost-effective way
        to stay connected during your trip. I've tried to do this in the past in
        Ethiopia and France with sporadic, frustrating results. At the time I
        made those trips, high-speed access wasn't consistently available
        everywhere I went.

      <h1>Belize: Use Airalo</h1>
      <p>
        For an upcoming trip to Belize with my family, we're going to try the
        Airalo eSIM combined with free WiFi options to save money and stay
        connected. Each option has its pros and cons, so I'll update this
        article as I learn more.
