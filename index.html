<p>Hey friends â€”</p>
<p>I'm Jeremy. I'm what Tyler Cowen has called a "Master Generalist." Because of my waist-deep knowledge in a lot of subjects, people frequently come to me for advice on everything from personal technology to home maintenance to finance to travel to education.</p>

<p>On this site, I've started to log the tools I use and advice I've given as the subjects come up. Hopefully, this can help you save money, time, and meet life goals.</p>
