    <h1>Using Credit Cards to Earn Travel</h1>
    <p>
      Just by buying gas, paying your cell phone bill, or getting lunch at work,
      you could take your next trip for free.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all spend money every day on housing, food, transportation,
      entertainment, and other things. Some people pay cash, use a debit card,
      or just apply for the credit card their bank offers them at the time of
      account opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, by shifting all your spending to certain credit cards strategically,
      you can maximize your ability to travel and travel the way you want. Here
      are the cards I currently use and how they fit into that strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to get the most points on every purchase. I do that by having
      multiple cards to cover as many categories as possible, and earning the
      vast majority of those points in one flexible currency.
    </p>
    <p>
      My currency of choice is Chase Ultimate Rewards. UR can be redeemed inside
      Chase's own Travel Portal or transferred to one of Chase's hotel or
      airline transfer partners.
    </p>
    <h2>Earning Points</h2>
    <h3>Everyday Spending</h3>
    <p>
      The CSR is the anchor for all my other cards. It earns 3x for each $1
      spent on travel worldwide. It currently earns 10x on Lyft rides. It also
      earns 3x on restaurants, including delivery services and take out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chase Freedom Unlimited Card also earns 3% on dining. Plus, it earns
      me 3% on drugstores and 1.5% on any purchases not covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chase Freedom Flex earns 5% on up to $1,500 in spending categories
      that rotate every quarter. For Q2 of 2023, for example, I earn 5% on all
      spending at Amazon or Lowes. And, for the first year, it earns 5% on
      grocery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the Chase Ink Business Cash credit card earns 5% on office
      supplies, internet, cable and phone services. It also earns 2% on gas.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, you can see that using the right card at the right place maximizes the
      points I can earn for travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Freedom and Ink cards above are $0 annual fee cash-back cards by
      themselves. But, when combined with the Sapphire Reserve, the cash back
      can be converted to UR!
    </p>
    <p>So, typical spending might look like this:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Go to the grocery store, spend $150 - use Freedom Flex, earn 750 points.
      </li>
      <li>
        Go to the gas station, spend $90 - use Ink Business Cash, earn 180
        points.
      </li>
      <li>Go to Starbucks, spend $15 - use Sapphire, earn 45 points.</li>
      <li>Pay your cable and internet bill ($75) - use Ink, earn 375 points</li>
      <li>Pay a $100 medical bill - use Freedom Unlimited, earn 150 points</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Total earnings: 1500 Ultimate Rewards points</p>
    <p>
      One night in the Hyatt Regency Paris Etoile today is 15,000 points. So,
      just this bit of everyday spending gets you 10% of the way there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, if you're using a debit card, writing checks, or using a random
      card issued by your bank, you'll missing out on the ability to help pay
      for your trips.
    </p>
    <h3>Sign-Up Bonuses</h3>
    <p>
      Just for signing up for these cards, Chase will reward you with a bonus if
      you meet a minimum required spending amount.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Chase Sapphire Reserve currently pays 60,000 after you spend $4,000
        in the first three months after opening the account.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Freedom Unlimited and Freedom Flex both pay a $200 bonus after you
        spend $500 in the first 3 months after opening the account. When
        converted to Ultimate Rewards points, that's 40,000 more points!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      So, signing up for these three cards in your first year of points
      collecting gets you 100,000 points. These sign-up bonuses alone get you 6
      nights of hotel in Paris with points to spare in your account!
    </p>
    <p>
      Disclosure: The below combination of cards is what I currently use to
      maximize points for travel or cash back on the things I spend the most on.
      If you purchase or sign up for some of the services below, I may receive a
      referral bonus of some kind. You pay no additional cost for this.
